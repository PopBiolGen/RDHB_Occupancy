# coords is a matrix of the observation coordinates used to estimate the spatial random effect for each site. 
# coords has two columns for the easting and northing coordinate, respectively. 
# Typically, each site in the data set will have it's own coordinate, such that coords is a 
# JÃ—2 matrix and grid.index should not be specified. 
# If you desire to estimate spatial random effects at some larger spatial level, 
# e.g., if points fall within grid cells and you want to estimate a spatial random effect for each grid cell instead of each point,
# coords can be specified as the coordinate for each grid cell. 
# In such a case, grid.index is an indexing vector of length J, 
# where each value of grid.index indicates the corresponding row in coords that the given site corresponds to. 
# Note that spOccupancy assumes coordinates are specified in a projected coordinate system.
